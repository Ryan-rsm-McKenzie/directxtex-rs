# DirectXTex Rust Bindings

These are unofficial Rust bindings for the DirectXTex texture processing library. A C++17 compliant compiler is required to build this library, and it is verified to work on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The docs contain a migration table that describes the equivalency between the original C++ API and its Rust bindings. Please see [DirectXTex's README](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/blob/main/README.md) for more info.

The stable release docs are available at: <https://docs.rs/directxtex/latest/directxtex/>

Changelogs are available at: <https://github.com/Ryan-rsm-McKenzie/directxtex-rs/releases>
